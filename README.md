# Churn Retention Predictive Analytics Project

# Introduction & Dataset Description
Customer churn—when customers discontinue their relationship with a business—is a pressing issue for companies seeking sustainable growth. For telecommunications providers, churn not only results in lost revenue but also increases costs associated with acquiring new customers. Nonetheless, customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, particularly in these telecommunication industries. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models, identify key drivers of churn, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention. The purpose of this report is to leverage data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict churn and understand its drivers, paving the way for actionable strategies that increase retention rates.

This project integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing steps, and advanced predictive models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Additionally, ethical considerations and interpretability efforts ensure responsible deployment of the insights derived from machine learning models.

# Significance of Churn Prediction
Effective churn prediction enables businesses to identify high-risk customers early and take proactive measures, such as offering incentives or addressing dissatisfaction. This approach not only reduces churn-related losses but also builds long-term customer loyalty.

# Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle’s Telco Customer Churn dataset, contains detailed records of customer demographics, service usage, payment methods, and subscription details. These features are critical in identifying patterns and correlations to predict churn effectively.
•	Size: 7,043 rows and 21 columns.

# Key Features: 
o	Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Dependents.
o	Subscription: Tenure, Contract type, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
o	Payment Details: PaymentMethod, PaperlessBilling.
o	Target Variable: Churn (binary: Yes/No).
